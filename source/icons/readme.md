# /source/icons/

This folder contains the icons that are going to be included into the integration.

The build script will generate a SVG file that contains the content of the `set.svg` image and will include the compiled CSS from the `styling.scss` style sheet. The generated file will be included into the .xpi extension with the name of `icons.svg`.
