![alt tag](preview.png)

> Tested in Thunderbird 45.8.0, GNOME 3.22.3, Debian GNU/Linux 9, Surface Pro 4, Arc Theme 20161119-1.

> Stability in other versions is not guaranteed, but you can still try.

## Notes

I still don't feel like that the project is ready to be considered "finished". However, I also thought that after one month the folks that are watching this repo would like to be aware of the progress. So here you go, version 0.3.0.

Because this project is still in alpha state, feedback is appreciated. Due to the lack of knowledge of how things work in Thunderbird, mess-ups may be very likely, therefore everyone is wellcome to report any visual bug that might be found.

## Features

 - Changes the appearance of the tabs to match the ones found in the official [Arc Firefox Theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-firefox-theme);
 - applies some style tweaks in the mail window;
 - restyles several buttons and fields;
 - integrates several icons;
 - also tweaks some parts of the calendar add-on (Lightning), e.g. the tasks side pane.

## Installation

 - Download the latest release (.xpi file) from [here](https://github.com/JD342/arc-thunderbird-integration/releases);
 - In Thunderbird, go to menu -> Add-ons;
 - There should be a button with a gear icon on the left side of the "Search all add-ons" bar, click it;
 - Click "Install Add-on from file...";
 - Find and select the downloaded .xpi file and install it;
 - restart Thunderbird;
 - enjoy.
